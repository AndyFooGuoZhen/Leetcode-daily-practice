# 1. Contains duplicate
- Use set to keep track of duplicates
- if element is not inside, add it to set
- return true if element is inside of set

# 2. Valid anagram (check if 2 strings have characters of the same count)
- Use 2 hashmaps for keeping track counts of each element from 2 strings
- return true if both hashmaps are the same, else return false

# 3. Two sum ( check if two elements in the list add up to target)
- Use hashmap for keeping track of elements
- if target - current element is in hashmap, return index of diff and index of current element
- else add element into hashmap, with index of the element as the value

# 4. Group anagrams ( group strings with the same anagrams)
- Create a hashmap, where the value is a list type , use collections.defaultdict(list) for this
- Iterate through each string in list, while iterating use count = [0] * 26 to create a list holding 26 elements of 0
- for each string, iterate through each character and use ord() to get ascii value of character, essentially we are coutning the number of a specific character for each string
- convert the list into tuple form at the end, and add it to hashmap via append ( hashMap[tuple(count)].append(current string) ) 

# 5. Top k frequent elements
- Use bucket sort, index represent count of the element
- create a hashmap, and a list containing len(nums) + 1 empty lists ( list index at 3 means count of element = 3)
- iterate through number array and keep update count of elements in hashmap
- iterate through hashmap and append elements according to count into the empty lists
- iterate list from reverse and append elements from sublist into result list until length of k is reached
